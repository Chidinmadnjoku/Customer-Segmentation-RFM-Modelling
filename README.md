# Customer-Segmentation-RFM-Modelling
The RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) model analyses customer value based on their transaction history. 
It is used to gain an understanding of the customer's behaviour based on three factors - Recency, Frequency and Monetary.

This analysis was done in Jupyter notebook, an EDA (Exploratory data analysis) was applied firstly find answers to questions like:
What is the average customer spend?
How frequently do they buy?
How long ago was their last transaction done?

The RFM values which are -Recency which calculates how many days ago the customer transacted with the business, Frequency which
calcutates the number of times they tranact with the business and Monetary that calculates how much the customer's transaction is worth.

The benefit of the RFM is that it helps the business with properly categorize their cusstomers based on their interaction with the business
to enhavce effective targetting of marketing startegies.
